# Requirements
## Introduction
  Today we need every thing fast. The same applies for computation. Creating a calculator with minimum error in calculation can help people get precise answer in minimum time.
  Creation of calculator helps in understanding arithmetic operations and pointers in C programming.
  
## Research
### Evolution of calculator
  In the early days, counting was done using fingers. However there is a limit when we use fingers to count. So mankind introduced the Abacus. Abacus is just the beginning of the   revolution in computation.
  * 1623 : First adding machine
  * 1773 : First functional calculator
  * 1820 : First commercially produced mechanical calculator
  * 1954 : First all-transistor calculator
  * 1961 : First all electronic desktop calculator
  * 1967 : First handheld calculator
  * 1971 : First pocket sized calculator using LED display
  * 1974 : First hand held programmable calculator
  * 1985 : First graphing calculator
  * 2003 : First Graphing Calculator with Touch Functionality
  * 2010 : First Color Graphing Calculator
  
### Benefits
  * Faster computation
  * Computation of extreme large data that cannot be calculated manually
  * Faster calculation of large amounts of data
  
### Disadvantages
  * The use of calculator has made us too dependent on them that it prevents us from using our own skills to compute
  * We blindly believe the computed value without checking if an error is introduced
 
## Cost and Features
  Entering any arithmetic expression
  Generate output in minimum time
  Check for irregular inputs
  
## Defining our System
  Input is taken as a string expression
  Calculation is done as per BODMAS rule
  Output will be generated
  Testing will be done to check incorrect inputs like alphabets, large numbers or NULL values

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who
  For all types of people using caluclator for basic arithmetic computation

## What
  For the purpose of saving time in computing by generating faster results of computation
  
## When
  The need for faster, efficient computation for large expressions and large number of data has been prevailing since human's learned about counting. It has become a pressing     need especially today with the emergence of technology, large amount of data and emergence of data analytics
  
## Where
  The need for calculator is prevelant in all parts of life, be it a student, teacher, engineer, shopkeeper or in data science
  
## How
  With calculator, computation becomes easier and faster as compared to human computation
